This repository contains a set of eco-hydraulic tools to analyse (small) streams. It is aimed at (regional) water managers to aid in getting insight, decision making and visualisation.

The dottertools are distributed as a Python package.

Getting started
===========

The easiest way to get started is to try out the interactive notebooks!

To learn more about Dotter, see our `documentation <https://github.com/kdberends/dotter/wiki>`__




Installation

The current development branch of dotter can be installed from GitHub, also using ``pip``:

::

Dependencies
============

Dotter is tested on Python 3.6 and depends on NumPy,
SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib (see ``requirements.txt`` for version
information).

Additionally, some notebooks make use of interactive widgets. To be able to correctly run the notebooks, you need to have ipywidgets installed and enabled; see `here <https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html>`__
